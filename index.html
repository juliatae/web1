<h2>Fitness</h2>
<p>Physical fitness is a state of health and well-being and, more specifically, the ability to perform aspects of sports, occupations and daily activities. Physical fitness is generally achieved through proper nutrition,[1] moderate-vigorous physical exercise,[2] and sufficient rest.[3]

Before the industrial revolution, fitness was defined as the capacity to carry out the dayâ€™s activities without undue fatigue. However, with automation and changes in lifestyles physical fitness is now considered a measure of the body's ability to function efficiently and effectively in work and leisure activities, to be healthy, to resist hypokinetic diseases, and to meet emergency situations<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_training"
  target="_blank" title="Weight_training">Weight training</a> is a common type of strength training for developing the strength and size of skeletal muscles.[2] It utilizes the force of gravity in the form of weighted bars, dumbbells or weight stacks in order to oppose the force generated by muscle through concentric or eccentric contraction.<strong> Weight training</strong> uses a variety of specialized equipment to target specific muscle groups and types of movement.<br><br>

Sports in which weight training is used are : bodybuilding, weightlifting, powerlifting, strongman, highland games, hammer throw, shot put, discus throw, and javelin throw.<u> Many other sports use strength training as part of their training regimen, notably</u>: American football, baseball, basketball, canoeing, cricket, football, hockey, lacrosse, mixed martial arts, rowing, rugby league, rugby union, track and field, boxing and wrestling.</P>
<p style="margin-top:45px;"><h1>Safety</h1><p>
</P>Weight training is a safe form of exercise when the movements are controlled and carefully defined. However, as with any form of exercise, improper execution and the failure to take appropriate precautions can result in injury. If injured, fully recovery is suggested before starting to weight train again or it will result in a bigger injury.</P><p style="margin-top:50px;"><img src="coding1.jpg" width="100%"></p>
<p><h1>Nurition</h1></p>
<p>Nutrition is the science that interprets the nutrients and other substances in food in relation to maintenance, growth, reproduction, health and disease of an organism. It includes ingestion, absorption, assimilation, biosynthesis, catabolism and excretion.[1]</p>
<img src="coding2.jpg" width="100%">
<p>The diet of an organism is what it eats, which is largely determined by the availability and palatability of foods. For humans, a healthy diet includes preparation of food and storage methods that preserve nutrients from oxidation, heat or leaching, and that reduces risk of foodborne illnesses. The seven major classes of human nutrients are carbohydrates, fats, fiber, minerals, proteins, vitamins, and water. Nutrients can be grouped as either macronutrients or micronutrients (needed in small quantities).In humans, an unhealthy diet can cause deficiency-related diseases such as blindness, anemia, scurvy, preterm birth, stillbirth and cretinism,[2] or nutrient excess health-threatening conditions such as obesity[3][4] and metabolic syndrome;[5] and such common chronic systemic diseases as cardiovascular disease,[6] diabetes,[7][8] and osteoporosis.[9][10][11] Undernutrition can lead to wasting in acute cases, and the stunting of marasmus in chronic cases of malnutrition.</p>
